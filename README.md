# Metal Gear Solid soundboard

This is a webb app made by @Wikiti (original work at https://github.com/wikiti/metal-gear-solid-soundboard), I made this copy to try to add a few music themes withouth breaking his app and his work.

Check the original app here:

https://wikiti.github.io/metal-gear-solid-soundboard

And this will be my version: 

https://deehalf.github.io/metal-gear-solid-soundboard

The app was mainly built using GitHub Copilot since Wikiti didn't want to over engineer this simple project.

## TODO

- Create the VR Stages

## Development

This is a regular react app, so just check `package.json` for commands, and play around with it!

## Contributors

This web app was developed by Daniel @wikiti, with the help of Eric @Zypzu and other BGG community members.
