# Metal Gear Solid soundboard

A simple web app to play sounds during a Metal Gear Solid by CMON play session. Check the app here:

https://wikiti.github.io/metal-gear-solid-soundboard

The app was mainly built using GitHub Copilot since I didn't want to over engineer this simple project.

## Development

This is a regular react app, so just check `package.json` for commands, and play around with it!

## Contributors

This web app was developed by Daniel @wikiti, with the help of Eric @Zypzu and other BGG community members.
